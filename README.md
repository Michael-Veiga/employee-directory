## Review

I chose to use hooks for this assignment because I was really struggling with the concept in class. I thought that by forcing myself to use them I would come out with a much stronger understanding. In all fairness I did learn quite a lot, however having only 1 week experience with react, my trial by fire ended up burning me quite a bit. In my countless hours of research I got lost in an information tsunami of hooks, state and redux. Luckily I was able to figure it out using online tutorials and the code from similarly built react tables. However I can't yet say with any real certainty that I have a solid understanding of these concepts. I will inevitably be dissecting this application in the near future, in hopes of attaining a better understanding.
